# BoneBrothMod
A simple modcomponent that adds a recipe for broth made from 20 bone fragments (from Modder's Toolbox), 1.5L Potable Water, and 0.01kg of Salt.
Currently shows that you are making "BORTH" - which is a bizarre Hinterland thing I do not know how to fix - until the broth is cooked.
Cooking from bones is slower (60 minutes before it hits the fire) than from ptarmigan carcasses.

Requires ModComponent and Modder's Toolbox.  Drop the Modcomponent file into Mods.
