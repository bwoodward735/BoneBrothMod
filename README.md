# BoneBrothMod
A simple modcomponent that adds a recipe for broth made from 20 bone fragments (from Modder's Toolbox), 1.5L Potable Water, and 0.01kg of Salt.
Currently shows that you are making "BORTH" - which is a bizarre Hinterland thing I do not know how to fix - until the broth is cooked.

Requires ModComponent and Modder's Toolbox.  Drop the Modcomponent file into Mods.
